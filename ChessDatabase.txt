https://syzygy-tables.info Use for endgames, I would recommend using the 3 to 5 piece tables sense the others are too big
https://everymanchess.com Use for books, gonna need to do some scraping for this one
https://huggingface.co/datasets/Lichess/chess-openings You found this one for openings, you can use this one, ball out (https://old.chesstempo.com/chess-openings.html alternative)
https://ratings.fide.com Use for masters, I would recommend only doing IM's and GM's (2400+), gonna need to scrape but this one should be easy (https://old.chesstempo.com/chess-players.html alternative)
https://ratings.fide.com/download.phtml Use for top 100 players through time, you have to download manual xml files for each year, they only have data going back to 2001 
** Still looking into matches table source **
